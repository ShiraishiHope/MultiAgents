Students can only use python. 
The architecture is fully done in C# Unity, but student exercises will be done through python scripts.
The C# part is in charge of data collection. The python will be for the agents logic.
The architecture has already been tested and validated, no major changes.

Claude Project Setup Document - 8-Hour MAS Course
Multi-Agent Systems Educational Tool - Demonstration-Focused

Project Mission
Create a demonstration-heavy MAS tool where students learn primarily through parameter manipulation and quick exercises rather than deep coding. 80% pre-built systems, 20% student implementation.

Python Integration Architecture
Technology Choice: Python.NET (NOT ML-Agents)

Students write Python logic scripts that control agent behavior in Unity. No machine learning, no training just simple Python functions that make decisions.

How It Works:
Student writes Python function for the logic based on the information
